                 <p>4736Ã—5296px | plugdata and field recording | video. Plugdata is a visual programming language for manipulating audio through signal diagrams. This series, incorporating field recordings of an audio installation and reading that took place at the Arizona border (see <i>ephemeralization project</i> (2024-), Johanna Skibskrud), imagines the desert landscape awash in digital signals and literally as a signal processing diagram. (Think, what could I draw by arranging the cables and boxes on the ground at an experimental music performance.) It is a response to living in one of the most surveilled places on earth, where microphones fly overhead and are buried in the earth. We capture what they record, and then play it back in an imagined in-situ.</p>

                <p>9x12 | watercolor and fiber | on paper. The cover of a book, translating the 1924 Jenkins Mars signal anomaly, created in workshop with Jonathan Keats to celebrate the 75th anniversary of `The Martian Chronicles' at Biosphere 2. The book now resides in the Biosphere 2 library permanent collection. Nothing more than the cover will be posted because the true seeker will make pilgrimage to the scriptorium.</p>
